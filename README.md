## QuickFix
An application made to assist people with busy lives to make dishes with items found in their fridge. 
Built with React, Styled-Components, Express.js, Javascript, Firebase, and PostgreSQL.

## Project Status
QuickFix is still currently under development. 
- As of right now, the front page displays four navigation elements that will allow users to navigate to the recipes, login, contact, and create dish pages
- Recipes will display 5 random recipes that could potentially catch a user's liking 
- Contact us page is still under development to be connected to EmailJS where users can send comments/concerns to an email.
- Recipes grabbed currently are only 5 random recipes and allows users to click and view the details of each recipe of interest

## Next Steps
- I want to be able to add a search bar to allow users to input ingredients that they want to use for their next dish. 
- Add a login system so that users can view favorited recipes and recent dishes made

## Reflection
This project was orginally a 2 day project for the immersive HackReactor course that I took in April of 2021. I started to pick it up again and fix up issues that I faced when I was originally working on it. 

Orignally I wanted to build an application that could assist my partner and I with new food ideas. I am passionate about cooking and love to do it as a hobby so developing an application of this nature seemed natural to me.

This project is challenging in the fact that I had to learn how to manage data flow to make sure that rendering would not take such a long time if a user wanted to view a specific recipe. I also am still learning how to pass down valid queries that users can input to search for recipes. 

An obstacle that I have run into is through Authentication. I have looked into the documentaion and attempted to implement it into the project but have not been successful.

Tools that I used for this project include: 
- React
- React-Router
- ExpressJS
- NodeJS
- PostgreSQL
- Webpack
- EmailJS
- Spoonacular API
- Styled-Compnents
